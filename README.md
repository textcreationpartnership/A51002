##Content Summary##

#####Body#####

1. MISERY to bee Lamented: Or, A Doleful Relation of the sad
Accident which befell Lawrence Cawthorn, a Journey-man-Butcher, belonging to
the Shambles in Newgate-Market, who being supposed to be dead, was caused to
be presently buried by his Lanlady Mris. Co•k,
in Pincock-Lane, only, as is supposed out of her greedy desire to gain his
cloaths. And how hee came to himself again, when hee was in the grave, as
appeared when hee was taken up, by the sad consequences of his strugling and
striving to get out of the Coffin, his arms being beaten black and blew, his
head bruised and swell'd as big as two heads, and his eyes starting almost out
of his head; It being also certainly reported, that he was heard to utter many
grievous shrieks and groans the time he lay under ground, which was from Friday
night, June 21. to Monday morning, June 24. 1661.
